					<description><![CDATA[WHOLE-OF-GOVERNMENT APPROACH GIVEN BOOST THROUGH LAUNCH OF TRAINING CURRICULUM Interior Ministry Chief Administrative Secretary (CAS) Hon. Amb. Hussein Dado has unveiled a training curriculum for Government officers stationed at Kenya’s points of entry and exit. Dubbed the Kenya Coordinated Border Management Programme (KCBMP), the curriculum was launched at the Kenya School of Government in Lower Kabete, Nairobi. The Curriculum will help enhance the whole-of-Government approach between Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) working in Kenya’s points of entry and exit which include land, air and maritime borders. Representing Interior Ministry Cabinet Secretary (CS) Dr. Fred Matiang’i at the event, Amb. Hussein Dado said: “As with all National Government business these days, I am delighted that, like border management, the programme also embraces a whole-of-Government approach and harnesses the capabilities and synergies inherent in all border departments.” The Curriculum was the brainchild of the KSG’s Security Management Institute (SMI) and the Border Management Secretariat (BMS). The latter acted on orders from the Border Control and Operations Coordination Committee (BCOCC), an organ chaired by Interior Principal Secretary (PS) Dr. Eng. Karanja Kibicho. According to Amb. Hon. Hussein Dado, it will now be mandatory for all Government officers working at Kenya’s border points to undergo training in order to continue inculcating the Whole-of-Government Approach in their day-to-day activities. “The Kenya Coordinated Border Management Programme will be escalated to the Cabinet level so that, through a policy, we shall make it mandatory for border agencies to ensure that their officers undergo the training. The training will ultimately make up part of their career progression,” Amb. Dado said. “The Curriculum will help border officials stay up to speed with latest global best practices in border management,” he added. The CAS further hailed the Curriculum saying that it will help Kenya become a regional and international exemplar in promotion of legitimate trade, travel and border security. “The Curriculum will help tackle challenges like smuggling of goods, persons, narcotics and ivory through Kenya’s points of entry and exit which include airports, land and sea borders.” Representing Interior Ministry Principal Secretary (PS), Dr. Eng. Karanja Kibicho, Secretary Internal Security Mr. Wilson Njega commended the collaboration between the KSG’s Security Management Institute and the BMS for developing the training Curriculum. He said it will be of immense benefit to all border officials. “It’s my expectation that this training manual will assist in equipping our border officials with the knowledge, competencies and skills to help them better execute their mandates.” Mr. Njega said that once all border officials undergo the training, he expects a seamless and coordinated approach towards border management and exceptional service delivery at all points of entry and exit. “The endgame is to ensure that delivery of services to people are synchronized, effective, efficient, versatile and advanced enough to respond to emerging issues and challenges.” The KSG Director General (DG) Prof. Ludeki Chweya appreciated the contribution that practitioners make in strengthening KSG’s training programmes by participating in curriculum development and the actual delivery of the programme. Further, Prof. Chweya urged for more research in the area of border security which he said would inform strategic capacity development. “Training effectiveness is also a function of research. It is important that we also conduct research in matters border management such as cross border security, flows and how it can be a challenge to national interest, cross national cooperation and technology. The research findings will enrich training,” said Prof. Chweya. Prof. Chweya lauded the importance that Interior Ministry has placed on building capacity of border officials which realized development of the coordinated border programme. “I thank the Ministry of Interior for recognizing the importance of building competencies to manage our borders better which led to the development of this curriculum. The programme is a product of the mobilization of expertise from the Kenya School of Government and Border Management Security.” BCOCC and BMS Secretary Mr. Kennedy Nyaiyo greeted the concerted efforts through the multi-agency approach, which he said, has seen the enhancement of legitimate trade and travel and heightened security in our borders. He added that the Curriculum will enhance the securitization process of our borders even more. Mr. Nyaiyo thanked National Government agencies and other organizations including the United States Customs and Border Protection (US CBP), International Organization on Migration (IOM), United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) for their continued support. Government organizations with officials stationed at Kenya’s borders/points of entry and exit and members of the BCOCC include: The National Police Service (NPS), Kenya Bureau of Standards (KEBS), the Immigration Department, the National Intelligence Service (NIS), the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA), Kenya Plant Health Inspectorate Service (KEPHIS), the Ministry of Health, Kenya Airports Authority (KAA), Kenya Ports Authority, Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) Kenya Coast Guard Service (KCGS), National Counter Terrorism Center (NCTC), among others. The aforementioned organizations also make up the membership of the BCOCC which was formed through the Security Laws (Amendment) Act, 2014, Section 75. The Committee was established, to among others, co-ordinate the exchange of information between the respective agencies responsible for the security and management of the borders at the designated entry and exit points.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Kenya School of Government collaborates with UN to strengthen infrastructure asset management in Kenya The Kenya School of Government (KSG) is partnering with United Nations agencies, including UN DESA, UNCDF, and UNOPS, to launch an innovative training program aimed at improving the management and maintenance of public infrastructure in Kenya. This initiative addresses critical challenges posed by climate change, shrinking fiscal budgets, and urbanization, which strain the country’s public services. The goal is to bolster the resilience, sustainability, and accessibility of infrastructure assets that provide essential services, such as water and sanitation, waste management, and transportation. In response to these pressing issues, a team of UN experts, led by Prof. Linda Newton, a global UN Advisor on Infrastructure Asset Management (IAM) conducted an intensive Training of Trainers workshop from June 23-27, 2024, for KSG faculty. This workshop aimed to enhance the faculty&#8217;s capacity to deliver IAM programs to National and County Governments. During the workshop&#8217;s opening, Dr. Daniel Platz from UNDESA highlighted research by UNOPSand the University of Oxford, which indicates that infrastructure significantly impacts all 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), affecting up to 92% of their targets. He noted the severe economic consequences of under-maintained infrastructure, with potential annual losses amounting to 2% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Mr. Humphrey Mokaya, Director of the Security Management Institute at KSG, underscored theimportance of equipping public servants with the necessary competencies and tools to manage infrastructure investments effectively for sustainable impact. KSG plans to leverage the extensive UN training toolkits on IAM and adapt them to the Kenyan context. Dr. Mkhululi Ncube of UNCDF emphasized the financial benefits of well-maintainedinfrastructure, stating, &#8220;Well-maintained infrastructure ensures reliable, equitable, and inclusive delivery of essential public services and significantly enhances fiscal space and promotes domestic resource mobilization. Between 70-85% of infrastructure costs typically occur after the construction phase. That is why IAM has become a central focus of UNCDF’s work on local government finance.&#8221; Mr. Luis Pineda of UN DESA reiterated the UN&#8217;s commitment to ongoing collaboration with KSG in designing and integrating new asset management modules into existing programs and developing new training modules for county governments. This partnership represents a significant step towards sustainable infrastructure management in Kenya, ensuring that public services remain resilient, accessible, and sustainable for all.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[MILESTONES ACHIEVED BY KSG IN THE TRANSFROMATION OF THE PUBLIC SERVICE The Kenya School of Government (KSG) is a national institution that responds continuously to capacity development needs across the Public Service by providing training to enhance knowledge,skills and competencies; consultancy services to support organizational reengineering; research to strengthen evidence-based public policymaking and implementation; and public outreach programs to promote uptake of Government programs. The School runs programs that are also continuously reviewed are specially designed to address real capacity gaps with manifest bearing on delivery of services by Ministries, Departments, Agencies and Counties (MDACs). KSG programs are therefore problem-solving interventions that have kept the Public Service on the path of transformation and rising capacity of each MDACs to cope with present and emerging organizational and performancechallenges and improve the quality of services that are offered to citizens. CountiesThe School has in the past ten years focused on supporting County Governments to steersuccessfully through some four critical challenges. The Constitution of Kenya 2010 introduced the devolved system of Government that had to be established on the ground and put into operation from the year 2013. KSG has been able to work with county Governments in establishing county structures, governmental and administrative systems, and development of human resource capacityto manage different functions and bear the enormous responsibilities bestowed by the constitution. The most outstanding of the support has been in the field of financial management with focus onIntegrated Financial Management Information System, Budgeting and Expenditure Management,and Financial Accounting, Reporting and Auditing. A challenge that counties faced was fulfilling the demanding mandate in Local EconomicDevelopment that called for competencies in project planning, implementation, monitoring andevaluation. The School has been able to develop and deliver training and consultancy assignments in these fields of competency requirements that has seen counties introduce and implement programs that continue to improve the living standards of their residents. Counties faced a formidable challenge in management of human resource that the School was on hand to assist in, namely inheritance of three categories of staff: staff that belonged to the defunct Local Authorities, national government staff whose functions had been devolved, and staff that were being recruited by counties. The three categories of staff reflected varied competency levels and work ethos, requiring therefore immediate efforts to create harmony through development of standard human resource policy documents and guidelines, and staff training needs assessment, and roll out of training. One of the transformational features of the Constitution of Kenya 2010 that counties had to abide by was the requirement for public participation in critical decision making matters, especially policy formulation, budget preparation, and development of County Integrated Development Plans(CIDPs). Partnership with the School to develop and implement strategies for public participationalong with offer of relevant training has produced positive results. Management of urban areas, including establishment of local-level governance structures, especially Municipal Boards and Management has been a challenge that the School has played a role in trying to overcome. The Governance and Management of Urban Areas and Cities program, for example,has been of much assistance in development and provision of services delivery system such as in waste management, physical planning, street lighting, and urban transport management, provision of fire services, and recreational facilities. Environmental and climate change mitigation is a new field of urgent concerns that counties had to grapple with in order to get onto the path of sustainable development. In this regard, the School continues to support counties in implementing international and national agenda such the Sustainable Development Goals and Climate Change mitigation, environmental impact assessment environmental and social safeguards; and trained county Climate Change Focal Persons with support from FAO. MinistriesThe civil service has in recent past attempted to come to grips with the compelling need forinnovation and adaptation. Accordingly, the School has developed and rolled out programs that encourage the search for new workways that enhance capacity to cope with new and emerging constrains in society and realize better results. Training in Change Management, Business Process Re-engineering, and productivity improvement have made a notable difference. Furthermore, inadequate preparations for succession management has in many cases constrained output andoverall organizational performance. Therefore, KSG has rolled out programs in skills and competency gaps analysis, Training Needs Assessments, and preparation of staff development plans in effort to address this challenge. Most sections of the civil service face frequent disruption of services due industrial disputes. In order to address this challenge, the School, in partnership with the Salaries and RemunerationCommission (SRC), has developed and rolled out a training program in Public Sector Collective Bargaining, resulting in improved work environment and stable industrial relations. The Kenya Constitution 2010 introduced within the Public Service some novel practices such as public access toinformation, mainstreaming Human Rights agenda in service delivery, and fair administrative action. In order to assist Ministries to adjust to the new requirements, the School runs some new and relevant training programs such in social protection, fair administrative action, and data protection. State CorporationsPublic sector Boards are entrusted with governance responsibility in State Corporations and othersemi-autonomous government agencies, particularly in respect of sound investment decisionsresulting in high returns and rather than losses. To this extent, the School has developed programs in public investment appraisal and risk analysis, Accounting Officers training, and Human Resource Management to align with expectations for returns rather than routine public administration, and performance evaluation and improvement. Sustainability of organizations in tumultuous environments such as the Covid-19 pandemic, globalfinancial economic crises, inflation and how to respond to these environments has placed many in tough situations. Leading Organizations in time of Crisis is one of the programs that the School has rolled out to facilitate overcoming the crunches presented to the Public Service. Mismatch of competencies with job placement has affected job satisfaction and consequentlyperformance of staff and the organization. In this regard the School conducts consultancies inrecruitment of executive staff on the strict criteria of merit; linking competencies to appointment byensuring the right people are appointed to positions through advertising, shortlisting, and selection of the most suitable candidate for [&#8230;]]]></description>

Partnership with the School to develop and implement strategies for public participation<br />along with offer of relevant training has produced positive results.</p><p>Management of urban areas, including establishment of local-level governance structures, especially Municipal Boards and Management has been a challenge that the School has played a role in trying to overcome. The Governance and Management of Urban Areas and Cities program, for example,<br />has been of much assistance in development and provision of services delivery system such as in waste management, physical planning, street lighting, and urban transport management, provision of fire services, and recreational facilities.</p><p>Environmental and climate change mitigation is a new field of urgent concerns that counties had to grapple with in order to get onto the path of sustainable development. In this regard, the School continues to support counties in implementing international and national agenda such the Sustainable Development Goals and Climate Change mitigation, environmental impact assessment <span style="color: var( --e-global-color-text ); font-family: var( --e-global-typography-text-font-family ), Sans-serif; font-weight: var( --e-global-typography-text-font-weight ); letter-spacing: 0em;">environmental and social safeguards; and trained county Climate Change Focal Persons with support </span><span style="color: var( --e-global-color-text ); font-family: var( --e-global-typography-text-font-family ), Sans-serif; font-weight: var( --e-global-typography-text-font-weight ); letter-spacing: 0em;">from FAO.</span></p><p><b>Ministries</b><br />The civil service has in recent past attempted to come to grips with the compelling need for<br />innovation and adaptation. Accordingly, the School has developed and rolled out programs that encourage the search for new workways that enhance capacity to cope with new and emerging constrains in society and realize better results. Training in Change Management, Business Process Re-engineering, and productivity improvement have made a notable difference. Furthermore, inadequate preparations for succession management has in many cases constrained output and<br />overall organizational performance. Therefore, KSG has rolled out programs in skills and competency gaps analysis, Training Needs Assessments, and preparation of staff development plans in effort to address this challenge.</p><p>Most sections of the civil service face frequent disruption of services due industrial disputes. In order to address this challenge, the School, in partnership with the Salaries and Remuneration<br />Commission (SRC), has developed and rolled out a training program in Public Sector Collective Bargaining, resulting in improved work environment and stable industrial relations. The Kenya Constitution 2010 introduced within the Public Service some novel practices such as public access to<br />information, mainstreaming Human Rights agenda in service delivery, and fair administrative action. In order to assist Ministries to adjust to the new requirements, the School runs some new and relevant training programs such in social protection, fair administrative action, and data protection.</p><p><b>State Corporations</b><br />Public sector Boards are entrusted with governance responsibility in State Corporations and other<br />semi-autonomous government agencies, particularly in respect of sound investment decisions<br />resulting in high returns and rather than losses. To this extent, the School has developed programs in public investment appraisal and risk analysis, Accounting Officers training, and Human Resource <span style="color: var( --e-global-color-text ); font-family: var( --e-global-typography-text-font-family ), Sans-serif; font-weight: var( --e-global-typography-text-font-weight ); letter-spacing: 0em;">Management to align with expectations for returns rather than routine public administration, and </span><span style="color: var( --e-global-color-text ); font-family: var( --e-global-typography-text-font-family ), Sans-serif; font-weight: var( --e-global-typography-text-font-weight ); letter-spacing: 0em;">performance evaluation and improvement.</span></p><p>Sustainability of organizations in tumultuous environments such as the Covid-19 pandemic, global<br />financial economic crises, inflation and how to respond to these environments has placed many in tough situations. Leading Organizations in time of Crisis is one of the programs that the School has rolled out to facilitate overcoming the crunches presented to the Public Service.</p><p>Mismatch of competencies with job placement has affected job satisfaction and consequently<br />performance of staff and the organization. In this regard the School conducts consultancies in<br />recruitment of executive staff on the strict criteria of merit; linking competencies to appointment by<br />ensuring the right people are appointed to positions through advertising, shortlisting, and selection of the most suitable candidate for the different positions in senior management. The aim is to enhance productivity and performance in State Corporations.</p><p>Further, the School runs induction programs to acquaint newly appointed staff, whether in Boards or management into the peculiar public sector doctrines, ethics, ethos and practices that in many ways tend to be different from what obtains in the private and NGO sectors.</p><p>Boards are trained on policy making and investment strategies for higher returns; public institutions but with private sector orientation; investment appraisal, good corporate governance, management<br />of Public Sector to overcome conflict within Boards, failure to appreciate the mandate of Boards, conflict with management, general stewardship of Boards, prudent utilization of resources, and<br />capacity building for prudent decision making for higher returns. Programs at the School that seek to address these challenges are: Accounting Officers Programs for CEOs, Corporate Governance<br />for Public Sector Boards, Induction programs, Finance for Non-finance Managers among others. <span style="color: var( --e-global-color-text ); font-family: var( --e-global-typography-text-font-family ), Sans-serif; font-weight: var( --e-global-typography-text-font-weight ); letter-spacing: 0em;">Cross Cutting Competencies in the Public Sector</span></p><p>The quality of public services and achievement of targets is not measured by the number of hours<br />put into the work by public officials but by the targets achieved within the hours put in. The School promotes this through results-based management programs such as Productivity Measurement and<br />Improvement as well as Performance Evaluation to ensure value driven public officers for best results in the public service.</p><p>Reports about loss of public funds and unaccountable use of public resources have brought to fore the need for the School to develop programs that promote public service doctrines, ethics, and values under the KSG Institute of Public Service Ethics and Values. Other programs in this genre aim to promote professionalism, particularly adherence to standard operational procedures as set out in different professional fields.</p><p>The e-Learning Development Institute has invested in the Learning Management System (LMS) and video conferencing that has been instrumental in the digitization of functions and operations in order to reach a wider clientele and enhance efficiency of the business process and service delivery programs. This was also strengthened through the response of the School to the Covid-19 pandemic by automation of most of its programs.</p>					</div>

					<description><![CDATA[Our Chief Guest, the Principal Secretary State Department for Internal Security and National Administration Dr. Raymond Omollo, Director General Kenya School of Government Prof. Ludeki Chweya, BCOCC Principals and BCOCC Contact Persons Development Partners; &#8211; IOM, USCBP, GIZ, UNODC&#8230;. Director &#8211; Security Management Institute Mr. Mokaya and team Border Management Secretariat team Border Officials /9th Cohort participants Ladies and Gentlemen, Good morning?   We thank our God for yet another opportunity to meet and undergo a 10 days training under the Reviewed Kenya Coordinated Border Management Program, popularly known as the Curriculum. I am aware that we have come from far and wide from Coast, Nyanza, Western North Eastern, Eastern, South Rift Valley and Nairobi Regions and that you arrived safely yesterday. We thank God for his journey mercies. I wish to thank our guest of honor for finding time from his busy schedule to be with us and grace this very important occasion in the calendar of BCOCC/BMS. As Chair BCOCC we are ever grateful and blessed with your presence amidst us. Equally I wish to thank KSG for being very dependable partners. The very fact that we are here again for this training is a clear testimony that the work we did together in reviewing this curriculum was not in vain. We ideally spent 2 weeks to review both the curriculum and the facilitators manual. This is the 9th cohort after successfully training close to 180 participants here in KSG Nairobi, Mombasa and Embu campuses respectively courtesy of BCOCC, UNODC and USCBP. I wish to take this early opportunity as well to thank our IOM partners for accepting to sponsor the 10th and 11th cohorts. This is besides the previous and continuous support we continue enjoying as an organization. The 5-year strategic plan sponsored by IOM revolutionized the way we do business at the secretariat. It speaks on: a) BCOCC/BMS existence /creation as per the Security Laws (Amendment) Act of 2014 Section 75 b) BCOCC/BMS Vision, Mission and Mandate c) Justification for the strategic plan for BCOCC d) On specific Key Results Areas (KRA) – Coordination of Border Operations; Border Security and Control; Institutional Capacity; with specific strategies, key activities and out comes as well as timelines for various activities to be undertaken in a span of 5 years. In a nutshell therefore, this Strategic Plan does help BCOCC/BMS realize its long-term vision by setting up goals and objectives in a systematic incremental manner. Another milestone, working with IOM was the development of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for Land, Air, and Maritime environments. This has enabled our officers in all our PoEs works seamlessly in a coordinated manner. Sir, our collaboration with development partners have eased pressure in our resource envelop hence enabled us to do much more as guided by our strategic plan We will be inviting you to receive a brand-new vehicle that will assist the secretariat in assessing far flung and remote areas of our country as we continue appraising our BMCs and viability of opening up more PoEs courtesy of IOM Let me be quick to mention that this training was sanctioned by the BCOCC to enable Ministries, Departments, and Agencies (MDAs) work as a team by embracing the “whole of government approach”. It is therefore, expected that you (the 9th cohort) will gain skills, knowledge and have the right attitude in the context of working as one besides adding value in the overall border management. The silo mentality, not sharing of information and resources, working in competition and duplicating efforts will be a thing of the past.   This course is meant to empower you on Coordinated Border Management (CBM), for the sole reason of enhancing legitimate trade, travel in a very secure environment. 11. Sir, as you are aware, the desire of this country is to move from Coordinated Border Management (CBM) to Integrated Border Management (IBM). Towards this end, we have partnered with Kenya School of Government to develop appropriate questionnaires This has been administered to the BMC membership. We shall do the same with the principals before the end of this month. We shall however rely on your guidance going forward. Once more feel welcome and let’s learn together to make our borders more safe and secure for trade and travel ‘Mipaka dhabiti kwa ustawi”  ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Salutations The Director General, Kenya School of Government Professor Ludeki&#160;Chweya&#160;Border Control and Operations Coordination Committee (BCOCC) Secretary&#160;and Head, Border Management Secretariat (BMS), Mr. Kennedy Nyaiyo,&#160;Director, Security Management Institute, Mr. Humphrey Mokaya,&#160;BCOCC contact persons from various MDAs,&#160;BMS staff as well as our esteemed participants&#160;Ladies and Gentlemen We are here today to acknowledge the significant progress Kenya has made in border management, transitioning from a reactive approach to a proactive, coordinated approach. It is with great pride that we launch the revised Kenya Coordinated Border Management Program (KCBMP), which will further strengthen our national security. Kenya&#8217;s strategic location in East Africa has long underscored the importance of effective border management in enhancing trade, ensuring national security, and promoting regional integration. Over the years, we have modernized our border operations, embraced technology, and fostered collaboration among various border agencies. In 2014, recognizing the need for a more efficient and integrated system, we established the Border Control and Operations Coordination Committee (BCOCC), which brings together various government agencies to enhance communication and streamline operations across land, air, and maritime borders. We have also implemented the Integrated Customs Management System (ICMS) and other technological tools to expedite the clearance of legitimate goods while effectively detecting contraband. Moreover, we are actively developing Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to ensure consistency and efficiency in border operations across all points of entry. These achievements have laid the foundation for the concept of Coordinated Border Management, emphasizing collaboration, information sharing, and a focus on both security and trade facilitation. This holistic approach allows us to enhance security by working together&#160;as different agencies to identify and address threats such as smuggling&#160;and terrorism, boost trade through faster clearance times and&#160;streamlined procedures, and improve revenue collection by enhancing&#160;the detection of duty-evaded goods.&#160;Ladies and Gentlemen The KCBMP is a groundbreaking initiative that reflects the commitment of the National Government to fortify and safeguard our national borders. The launch and rollout of this revised program signifies a vital step towards ensuring the security and efficiency of Kenya&#8217;s ports of entry &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;and exit. The updated program encompasses critical dimensions of border management, including Governance structures for cooperation and Emerging Trends and Technologies. It delves into the intricacies of a border management system that embraces both domestic coordination within and between agencies in the country as well as international coordination involving collaboration between neighboring countries and trading partners to enhance security and promote economic and social cohesion. This program aims to streamline policies and procedures across government agencies, allowing for a more coordinated and efficient approach in tackling organized crime and other threats that undermine peace, security, and sustainable development. Furthermore, it encourages a unified accountability framework and the sharing of resources to enhance the overall effectiveness of border agencies. The program also recognizes the significance of managerial skills in border management, which are indispensable for our officers as they navigate diverse situations daily, ensuring the safety and efficient movement of people and goods across our ports of entry and exit. Ladies and Gentlemen This Program is designed to provide a practical and hands-on approach to bolster the abilities of our front-line officers, reflecting our commitment to addressing the evolving challenges of border security. It is crucial to ensure that all border officers are equipped with the necessary knowledge and skills to effectively manage the complexities of border operations. As we commence training the ninth cohort, I commend the Border Management Secretariat and KSG’s Security Management Institute for their tireless effort to ensure our frontline officers are well trained. Likewise, I express my gratitude to our partners, including the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), and the United States Customs and Border Patrol (USCBP), for their continued support that benefits not only Kenya but also the entire East Africa region. I am pleased to announce that the Secretariat, in collaboration with IOM, has planned the National Border Conference to be held in Nairobi from 2nd to 4th April 2024. This conference will provide a platform for stakeholders to engage in enhancing Coordinated Border Management and support the implementation of BCOCC’s five-year strategic plan. To the ninth cohort commencing this training, I urge you to embrace the knowledge imparted with enthusiasm and dedication. You are the guardians of our borders, the sentinels who ensure the integrity of our nation. May this training be a catalyst for excellence in border management. Thank you, and may we continue to work together towards a safer and&#160;more secure Kenya.]]></description>

<p></p>
<ol start="11">
<li>As we commence training the ninth cohort, I commend the Border Management Secretariat and KSG’s Security Management Institute for their tireless effort to ensure our frontline officers are well trained. Likewise, I express my gratitude to our partners, including the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), and the United States Customs and Border Patrol (USCBP), for their continued support that benefits not only Kenya but also the entire East Africa region.</li></ol>
<p></p>
<ol start="12">
<li>I am pleased to announce that the Secretariat, in collaboration with IOM, has planned the National Border Conference to be held in Nairobi from 2nd to 4th April 2024. This conference will provide a platform for stakeholders to engage in enhancing Coordinated Border Management and support the implementation of BCOCC’s five-year strategic plan.</li></ol>
<p></p>
<ol start="13">
<li>To the ninth cohort commencing this training, I urge you to embrace the knowledge imparted with enthusiasm and dedication. You are the guardians of our borders, the sentinels who ensure the integrity of our nation. May this training be a catalyst for excellence in border management.</li></ol>

					<description><![CDATA[Mandera County Governor, Mohamed Adan Khalif, has this morning opened an Induction Course for the County Executive Committee (CECs) at Kenya School of Government Lower Kabete. The Governor was received by the School’s Director General Prof. Ludeki Chweya, Director Finance, Administration Prof. Nura Mohamed, and Deputy Director Learning and Development, Dr. Rukia Atikiya. Governor Khalif has acknowledged AMREF- Kenya for partnering with County Governments in building the capacity of leaders and has further urged the CECs to ensure that through the training, they will serve the citizens of Mandera wholeheartedly. The Kenya Learning and Development Centre (KDLC), later e-Learning and Development Institute (eLDi), is the product of a joint funding Agreement between the Government of Kenya and the World Bank (International Development Association) in November 2003. The project aimed at strengthening the capacity of Kenyan civil servants and policy makers for proper planning and implementation of social and economic development strategies and programs. For purposes of operationalization, KDLC was anchored in the Ministry of State for Public Service in 2003 by an order of the Minister of Education, Science and Technology under section 10 of the Education Act Cap 211 of the Laws of Kenya. The project was located at the Kenya Institute of Administration (KIA) and became a member of Association of Africa Distance Learning Centers (AADLC and an affiliate of the Global Development Learning Network (GDLN), a worldwide partnership of over 120 learning centers in 80 countries around the world that use advanced technologies and distance learning techniques innovatively to connect people working on development around the world for capacity building events. KDLC was equipped with state-of-the art Information Communication Technologies that includes an air conditioned and sound proof video conference room and multimedia laboratories with high speed internet. In 2012, the Implementation Committee mission assessed the KDLC Monitoring and Evaluation (in full) system and was generally gleaned as reliable and appropriate for the types of data KDLC was collecting. Assessment [of the 2008 -2011] specifically gleaned that KDLC had successfully offered over 364 capacity development training events of which 80 are Multimedia; 271 video conferences; and 13 face-to-face events. These skill development and capacity building programs, addressed learning programs such as: Financial Management Micro-Finance Electronic Records Management Leadership Dynamics for Senior Women Managers Combating Corruption in Procurement Fraud Investigation, Detection and Prevention Strategic Environment Assessment Development Policy; and Project Monitoring &#38; Evaluation. When the Kenya School of Government&#160;Act became effective on July 1st 2012, KDLC [now eLDi] joined GTIs and KIA to form the School.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[KSG and the National School of Government of South Africa have entered into a Memorandum of Understanding for collaboration and cooperation for delivery of capacity building, consultancy, research and joint publications that will promote national development and proficiency in the Public Service. The MoU was signed by KSG Director General, Prof. Ludeki Chweya and the Principal of NSG, Mr. Busani Ngcaweni at a ceremony witnessed by the President of Kenya, H.E. William Ruto and H.E. Cyril Ramaphosa, President of South Africa at State House, Nairobi. On the MoU between KSG and NSG, it is worth noting that both Schools of Government have similarities in terms of their formation, affiliations and operations. While KSG is a state corporation established under the Kenya School of Government Act (No. 9 of 2012), NSG was established in terms of section 4(1) of the Public Service Act, 1994 (Proclamation 103 of 1994) in the Republic of South Africa. They are members of the African Management Development Management Institute Network (AMDIN), an association of Management Development Institutes in the African continent liable for exchanging knowledge and sharing of best practices with other like-minded institutions with a common vision in the areas of capacity building in the public service. Prof. Chweya is the President of AMDIN responsible for the coordination of the activities of the Network. Their similar operations in capacity development, research, policy advisory and consultancy services are relevant for the partnership that seeks to collaborate in; exchange of information and expertise through study visits and cross fertilization of programs, joint research, and conferencing and seminars, co-publishing of research articles and any other areas of interest.]]></description>
