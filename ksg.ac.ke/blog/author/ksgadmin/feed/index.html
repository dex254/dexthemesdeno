					<description><![CDATA[Mandera County Governor, Mohamed Adan Khalif, has this morning opened an Induction Course for the County Executive Committee (CECs) at Kenya School of Government Lower Kabete. The Governor was received by the School’s Director General Prof. Ludeki Chweya, Director Finance, Administration Prof. Nura Mohamed, and Deputy Director Learning and Development, Dr. Rukia Atikiya. Governor Khalif has acknowledged AMREF- Kenya for partnering with County Governments in building the capacity of leaders and has further urged the CECs to ensure that through the training, they will serve the citizens of Mandera wholeheartedly. The Kenya Learning and Development Centre (KDLC), later e-Learning and Development Institute (eLDi), is the product of a joint funding Agreement between the Government of Kenya and the World Bank (International Development Association) in November 2003. The project aimed at strengthening the capacity of Kenyan civil servants and policy makers for proper planning and implementation of social and economic development strategies and programs. For purposes of operationalization, KDLC was anchored in the Ministry of State for Public Service in 2003 by an order of the Minister of Education, Science and Technology under section 10 of the Education Act Cap 211 of the Laws of Kenya. The project was located at the Kenya Institute of Administration (KIA) and became a member of Association of Africa Distance Learning Centers (AADLC and an affiliate of the Global Development Learning Network (GDLN), a worldwide partnership of over 120 learning centers in 80 countries around the world that use advanced technologies and distance learning techniques innovatively to connect people working on development around the world for capacity building events. KDLC was equipped with state-of-the art Information Communication Technologies that includes an air conditioned and sound proof video conference room and multimedia laboratories with high speed internet. In 2012, the Implementation Committee mission assessed the KDLC Monitoring and Evaluation (in full) system and was generally gleaned as reliable and appropriate for the types of data KDLC was collecting. Assessment [of the 2008 -2011] specifically gleaned that KDLC had successfully offered over 364 capacity development training events of which 80 are Multimedia; 271 video conferences; and 13 face-to-face events. These skill development and capacity building programs, addressed learning programs such as: Financial Management Micro-Finance Electronic Records Management Leadership Dynamics for Senior Women Managers Combating Corruption in Procurement Fraud Investigation, Detection and Prevention Strategic Environment Assessment Development Policy; and Project Monitoring &#38; Evaluation. When the Kenya School of Government&#160;Act became effective on July 1st 2012, KDLC [now eLDi] joined GTIs and KIA to form the School.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[KSG and the National School of Government of South Africa have entered into a Memorandum of Understanding for collaboration and cooperation for delivery of capacity building, consultancy, research and joint publications that will promote national development and proficiency in the Public Service. The MoU was signed by KSG Director General, Prof. Ludeki Chweya and the Principal of NSG, Mr. Busani Ngcaweni at a ceremony witnessed by the President of Kenya, H.E. William Ruto and H.E. Cyril Ramaphosa, President of South Africa at State House, Nairobi. On the MoU between KSG and NSG, it is worth noting that both Schools of Government have similarities in terms of their formation, affiliations and operations. While KSG is a state corporation established under the Kenya School of Government Act (No. 9 of 2012), NSG was established in terms of section 4(1) of the Public Service Act, 1994 (Proclamation 103 of 1994) in the Republic of South Africa. They are members of the African Management Development Management Institute Network (AMDIN), an association of Management Development Institutes in the African continent liable for exchanging knowledge and sharing of best practices with other like-minded institutions with a common vision in the areas of capacity building in the public service. Prof. Chweya is the President of AMDIN responsible for the coordination of the activities of the Network. Their similar operations in capacity development, research, policy advisory and consultancy services are relevant for the partnership that seeks to collaborate in; exchange of information and expertise through study visits and cross fertilization of programs, joint research, and conferencing and seminars, co-publishing of research articles and any other areas of interest.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Remarks by the Director General, Prof. Ludeki Chweya, Ph.D., CBS, During the Second Graduation Ceremony for the Award of Diplomas at Lower Kabete on March 6, 2019 The Chief Guest, Prof. Margaret Kobia, Cabinet Secretary for Public Service, Youth &#38; Gender Dr. Fred Matiang’i, Cabinet Secretary, Ministry of Interior and Coordination of National Government Prof. Francis Kibera, Chairman, Kenya School of Government Council Members of the Council of the Kenya School of Government Kenya School of Government Directors Government officers present Distinguished Graduands Management and Staff of the Kenya School of Government Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen This day stands out prominently in the academic calendar of the Kenya School of Government, for on this occasion, we take a break from the very demanding and even depressing routine of lectures, seminar presentations, group work, assignments and, what is more – examinations. Today, we graduands receive the assurance that this rigor has come to an end – at least for some time. Today, we assemble in this Great Hall to celebrate successful completion of a long process of learning. Needless to say, many find learning that is realized spontaneously in the course of professional career or social life generally to be a lot easier than the structured, compressed, and compulsory Diploma in Social Work and Diploma in Public Administration programs that have, moreover, taken you away from family, friends and the community for such a long period of time. Congratulations therefore for successful completion of the programs of study and for the award of Diploma in your respective professional fields. Well done in the search for new knowledge and in sharing with others that which you already knew. Congratulations for the readiness you displayed to unlearn that which you erroneously believed to be the ultimate knowledge and your readiness to supplant it with new, more current ideas and perspectives on different aspects of your professional field. I have been impressed by your quick appreciation that knowledge is truly transitory and that a learner is well advised to keep abreast with ever-shifting knowledge trends. Such shifts have become even more routine in the face of the ever-increasing complexities in human society, particularly in the Governance realm. Public servants are responsible for management of societal affairs, and they will invariably find it compelling to run ahead of the population whom they serve in respect of appreciation of societal phenomena and invocation of appropriate initiatives or responses as the case may be. Couldn’t one say therefore with much certainty that a public servant who remains fixated in old knowledge and old workways thereby locks up oneself in a voluntary servitude of ignorance and irrelevance, inflicting much harm to one’s own professional reputation and to citizens in their prospects for high-level delivery of public service. But there is also the matter of where to excavate the new knowledge from, for we have to be weary of false prophets: one faces the formidable risk of exposure to knowledge of tenuous credibility. Thankfully, in this regard, the Kenya School of Government has been and will remain on hand to fulfil its obligation to transform the Kenyan public service into the most efficient and capable engine for service delivery and implementation of Government agenda for social and economic transformation and progress. We have therefore realigned all our programs to match Government priorities defined in the Big 4 Agenda, the Kenya V2030, SDGs and Africa Agenda 2063. Further, we have taken all necessary measures to underwrite the quality standards of our skills and competency development programs. We are now on the same. In conclusion, I confirm that the graduands before you have successfully completed the prescribed program and have the necessary knowledge, skills, and competencies to discharge their duties to the satisfaction of the expectations of their Ministries and the citizens.]]></description>

<p>By <b>Beth Muigai</b></p>
<p>Thomas Nils Sterner, a Swedish economist and professor wrote in his book ‘The Practicing Mind’ that when we practice something, we are involved in the deliberate repetition of a process with the intention of reaching a specific goal. The words deliberate and intention are important in this statement as they draw the line between actively practicing something and passively learning it. It is a choice that one makes when they have had the advantage to be taught or learn a new skill.</p>
<p>This is the challenge the Director Security Management Institute, Mr. Humphrey Mokaya put to County Engagement Forum (CEF) members in his address during the closing ceremony of the Prevention and Control of Violent Extremism program on Friday 27th August, 2021 at KSG Lower Kabete. “After your training, let us see change in all you do; change from how we have been doing things to adopting a new way.”</p>
<p>Mr. Mokaya highlighted on the need for drastic action in the area of Violent Extremism which has been a security agenda in our country and region for years now. He reminded the graduands of the delicate nature of the issue of Violent Extremism that requires a lot of tact in countering the vice. “Let us not forget the fragility of this issue and the diplomacy that is required in handling it. Of importance, is enlightening those that you work with.”</p>
<p>He reminded them on the significance of maintaining networks with colleagues which will enable them exchange information and in the process, develop better ways of dealing with security in their region. “It is one of the best ways to increase your information base,” he said.</p>
<p>His words were echoed by Mr. Cheboi, a representative of the National Counter Terrorism Center (NCTC) as he delivered a speech on behalf of the Institution‘s Acting Director, Dr. Roslyn Macharia. “What we seeing unfold in Afghanistan is a risk we face in our country should we chose to remain silent on the issue of Violent extremism,” the speech read in part. “It should be a call to all of us, to do more than the usual after this training so that we will not have to deal with a caliphate which is the bigger picture of the current situation in our country and region”.</p>
<p>Prevention and control of Violent Extremism is a program that was developed by the School‘s Security Management Institute in collaboration with the National Counter Terrorism Center and Mercy Corps. It attracts personnel in the security sector at the county level as well as the national level to undergo training in order for them to understand the vice and develop strategies to curb it more efficiently. In the past one decade, Kenya has experienced several terror attacks and terror related threats that are associated with outlawed militia groups. In order to carry out such activities, these groups recruit the youth and train them to carry attacks in different parts of the country. It therefore creates the need to be a step ahead to identify networks and patterns of such recruitments and activities happening in a region.</p>
<p>The Kenya School of Government has been on the forefront to ensure that it brings on board the best facilitators for this program. Class president Ms. Kezia Neema acknowledged the expertise demonstrated in every class. “There were different facilitators for every class, and each one of them made you desire to learn more. It was in the delivery of the information and professional way that every topic was handled that makes KSG the best institution,” she said.</p>
