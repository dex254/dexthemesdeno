					<description><![CDATA[Mandera County Governor, Mohamed Adan Khalif, has this morning opened an Induction Course for the County Executive Committee (CECs) at Kenya School of Government Lower Kabete. The Governor was received by the School’s Director General Prof. Ludeki Chweya, Director Finance, Administration Prof. Nura Mohamed, and Deputy Director Learning and Development, Dr. Rukia Atikiya. Governor Khalif has acknowledged AMREF- Kenya for partnering with County Governments in building the capacity of leaders and has further urged the CECs to ensure that through the training, they will serve the citizens of Mandera wholeheartedly. The Kenya Learning and Development Centre (KDLC), later e-Learning and Development Institute (eLDi), is the product of a joint funding Agreement between the Government of Kenya and the World Bank (International Development Association) in November 2003. The project aimed at strengthening the capacity of Kenyan civil servants and policy makers for proper planning and implementation of social and economic development strategies and programs. For purposes of operationalization, KDLC was anchored in the Ministry of State for Public Service in 2003 by an order of the Minister of Education, Science and Technology under section 10 of the Education Act Cap 211 of the Laws of Kenya. The project was located at the Kenya Institute of Administration (KIA) and became a member of Association of Africa Distance Learning Centers (AADLC and an affiliate of the Global Development Learning Network (GDLN), a worldwide partnership of over 120 learning centers in 80 countries around the world that use advanced technologies and distance learning techniques innovatively to connect people working on development around the world for capacity building events. KDLC was equipped with state-of-the art Information Communication Technologies that includes an air conditioned and sound proof video conference room and multimedia laboratories with high speed internet. In 2012, the Implementation Committee mission assessed the KDLC Monitoring and Evaluation (in full) system and was generally gleaned as reliable and appropriate for the types of data KDLC was collecting. Assessment [of the 2008 -2011] specifically gleaned that KDLC had successfully offered over 364 capacity development training events of which 80 are Multimedia; 271 video conferences; and 13 face-to-face events. These skill development and capacity building programs, addressed learning programs such as: Financial Management Micro-Finance Electronic Records Management Leadership Dynamics for Senior Women Managers Combating Corruption in Procurement Fraud Investigation, Detection and Prevention Strategic Environment Assessment Development Policy; and Project Monitoring &#38; Evaluation. When the Kenya School of Government&#160;Act became effective on July 1st 2012, KDLC [now eLDi] joined GTIs and KIA to form the School.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[KSG and the National School of Government of South Africa have entered into a Memorandum of Understanding for collaboration and cooperation for delivery of capacity building, consultancy, research and joint publications that will promote national development and proficiency in the Public Service. The MoU was signed by KSG Director General, Prof. Ludeki Chweya and the Principal of NSG, Mr. Busani Ngcaweni at a ceremony witnessed by the President of Kenya, H.E. William Ruto and H.E. Cyril Ramaphosa, President of South Africa at State House, Nairobi. On the MoU between KSG and NSG, it is worth noting that both Schools of Government have similarities in terms of their formation, affiliations and operations. While KSG is a state corporation established under the Kenya School of Government Act (No. 9 of 2012), NSG was established in terms of section 4(1) of the Public Service Act, 1994 (Proclamation 103 of 1994) in the Republic of South Africa. They are members of the African Management Development Management Institute Network (AMDIN), an association of Management Development Institutes in the African continent liable for exchanging knowledge and sharing of best practices with other like-minded institutions with a common vision in the areas of capacity building in the public service. Prof. Chweya is the President of AMDIN responsible for the coordination of the activities of the Network. Their similar operations in capacity development, research, policy advisory and consultancy services are relevant for the partnership that seeks to collaborate in; exchange of information and expertise through study visits and cross fertilization of programs, joint research, and conferencing and seminars, co-publishing of research articles and any other areas of interest.]]></description>
