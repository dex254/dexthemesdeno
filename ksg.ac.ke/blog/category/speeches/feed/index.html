					<description><![CDATA[Our Chief Guest, the Principal Secretary State Department for Internal Security and National Administration Dr. Raymond Omollo, Director General Kenya School of Government Prof. Ludeki Chweya, BCOCC Principals and BCOCC Contact Persons Development Partners; &#8211; IOM, USCBP, GIZ, UNODC&#8230;. Director &#8211; Security Management Institute Mr. Mokaya and team Border Management Secretariat team Border Officials /9th Cohort participants Ladies and Gentlemen, Good morning?   We thank our God for yet another opportunity to meet and undergo a 10 days training under the Reviewed Kenya Coordinated Border Management Program, popularly known as the Curriculum. I am aware that we have come from far and wide from Coast, Nyanza, Western North Eastern, Eastern, South Rift Valley and Nairobi Regions and that you arrived safely yesterday. We thank God for his journey mercies. I wish to thank our guest of honor for finding time from his busy schedule to be with us and grace this very important occasion in the calendar of BCOCC/BMS. As Chair BCOCC we are ever grateful and blessed with your presence amidst us. Equally I wish to thank KSG for being very dependable partners. The very fact that we are here again for this training is a clear testimony that the work we did together in reviewing this curriculum was not in vain. We ideally spent 2 weeks to review both the curriculum and the facilitators manual. This is the 9th cohort after successfully training close to 180 participants here in KSG Nairobi, Mombasa and Embu campuses respectively courtesy of BCOCC, UNODC and USCBP. I wish to take this early opportunity as well to thank our IOM partners for accepting to sponsor the 10th and 11th cohorts. This is besides the previous and continuous support we continue enjoying as an organization. The 5-year strategic plan sponsored by IOM revolutionized the way we do business at the secretariat. It speaks on: a) BCOCC/BMS existence /creation as per the Security Laws (Amendment) Act of 2014 Section 75 b) BCOCC/BMS Vision, Mission and Mandate c) Justification for the strategic plan for BCOCC d) On specific Key Results Areas (KRA) – Coordination of Border Operations; Border Security and Control; Institutional Capacity; with specific strategies, key activities and out comes as well as timelines for various activities to be undertaken in a span of 5 years. In a nutshell therefore, this Strategic Plan does help BCOCC/BMS realize its long-term vision by setting up goals and objectives in a systematic incremental manner. Another milestone, working with IOM was the development of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for Land, Air, and Maritime environments. This has enabled our officers in all our PoEs works seamlessly in a coordinated manner. Sir, our collaboration with development partners have eased pressure in our resource envelop hence enabled us to do much more as guided by our strategic plan We will be inviting you to receive a brand-new vehicle that will assist the secretariat in assessing far flung and remote areas of our country as we continue appraising our BMCs and viability of opening up more PoEs courtesy of IOM Let me be quick to mention that this training was sanctioned by the BCOCC to enable Ministries, Departments, and Agencies (MDAs) work as a team by embracing the “whole of government approach”. It is therefore, expected that you (the 9th cohort) will gain skills, knowledge and have the right attitude in the context of working as one besides adding value in the overall border management. The silo mentality, not sharing of information and resources, working in competition and duplicating efforts will be a thing of the past.   This course is meant to empower you on Coordinated Border Management (CBM), for the sole reason of enhancing legitimate trade, travel in a very secure environment. 11. Sir, as you are aware, the desire of this country is to move from Coordinated Border Management (CBM) to Integrated Border Management (IBM). Towards this end, we have partnered with Kenya School of Government to develop appropriate questionnaires This has been administered to the BMC membership. We shall do the same with the principals before the end of this month. We shall however rely on your guidance going forward. Once more feel welcome and let’s learn together to make our borders more safe and secure for trade and travel ‘Mipaka dhabiti kwa ustawi”  ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Salutations The Director General, Kenya School of Government Professor Ludeki&#160;Chweya&#160;Border Control and Operations Coordination Committee (BCOCC) Secretary&#160;and Head, Border Management Secretariat (BMS), Mr. Kennedy Nyaiyo,&#160;Director, Security Management Institute, Mr. Humphrey Mokaya,&#160;BCOCC contact persons from various MDAs,&#160;BMS staff as well as our esteemed participants&#160;Ladies and Gentlemen We are here today to acknowledge the significant progress Kenya has made in border management, transitioning from a reactive approach to a proactive, coordinated approach. It is with great pride that we launch the revised Kenya Coordinated Border Management Program (KCBMP), which will further strengthen our national security. Kenya&#8217;s strategic location in East Africa has long underscored the importance of effective border management in enhancing trade, ensuring national security, and promoting regional integration. Over the years, we have modernized our border operations, embraced technology, and fostered collaboration among various border agencies. In 2014, recognizing the need for a more efficient and integrated system, we established the Border Control and Operations Coordination Committee (BCOCC), which brings together various government agencies to enhance communication and streamline operations across land, air, and maritime borders. We have also implemented the Integrated Customs Management System (ICMS) and other technological tools to expedite the clearance of legitimate goods while effectively detecting contraband. Moreover, we are actively developing Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to ensure consistency and efficiency in border operations across all points of entry. These achievements have laid the foundation for the concept of Coordinated Border Management, emphasizing collaboration, information sharing, and a focus on both security and trade facilitation. This holistic approach allows us to enhance security by working together&#160;as different agencies to identify and address threats such as smuggling&#160;and terrorism, boost trade through faster clearance times and&#160;streamlined procedures, and improve revenue collection by enhancing&#160;the detection of duty-evaded goods.&#160;Ladies and Gentlemen The KCBMP is a groundbreaking initiative that reflects the commitment of the National Government to fortify and safeguard our national borders. The launch and rollout of this revised program signifies a vital step towards ensuring the security and efficiency of Kenya&#8217;s ports of entry &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;and exit. The updated program encompasses critical dimensions of border management, including Governance structures for cooperation and Emerging Trends and Technologies. It delves into the intricacies of a border management system that embraces both domestic coordination within and between agencies in the country as well as international coordination involving collaboration between neighboring countries and trading partners to enhance security and promote economic and social cohesion. This program aims to streamline policies and procedures across government agencies, allowing for a more coordinated and efficient approach in tackling organized crime and other threats that undermine peace, security, and sustainable development. Furthermore, it encourages a unified accountability framework and the sharing of resources to enhance the overall effectiveness of border agencies. The program also recognizes the significance of managerial skills in border management, which are indispensable for our officers as they navigate diverse situations daily, ensuring the safety and efficient movement of people and goods across our ports of entry and exit. Ladies and Gentlemen This Program is designed to provide a practical and hands-on approach to bolster the abilities of our front-line officers, reflecting our commitment to addressing the evolving challenges of border security. It is crucial to ensure that all border officers are equipped with the necessary knowledge and skills to effectively manage the complexities of border operations. As we commence training the ninth cohort, I commend the Border Management Secretariat and KSG’s Security Management Institute for their tireless effort to ensure our frontline officers are well trained. Likewise, I express my gratitude to our partners, including the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), and the United States Customs and Border Patrol (USCBP), for their continued support that benefits not only Kenya but also the entire East Africa region. I am pleased to announce that the Secretariat, in collaboration with IOM, has planned the National Border Conference to be held in Nairobi from 2nd to 4th April 2024. This conference will provide a platform for stakeholders to engage in enhancing Coordinated Border Management and support the implementation of BCOCC’s five-year strategic plan. To the ninth cohort commencing this training, I urge you to embrace the knowledge imparted with enthusiasm and dedication. You are the guardians of our borders, the sentinels who ensure the integrity of our nation. May this training be a catalyst for excellence in border management. Thank you, and may we continue to work together towards a safer and&#160;more secure Kenya.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Remarks by the Director General, Prof. Ludeki Chweya, Ph.D., CBS, During the Second Graduation Ceremony for the Award of Diplomas at Lower Kabete on March 6, 2019 The Chief Guest, Prof. Margaret Kobia, Cabinet Secretary for Public Service, Youth &#38; Gender Dr. Fred Matiang’i, Cabinet Secretary, Ministry of Interior and Coordination of National Government Prof. Francis Kibera, Chairman, Kenya School of Government Council Members of the Council of the Kenya School of Government Kenya School of Government Directors Government officers present Distinguished Graduands Management and Staff of the Kenya School of Government Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen This day stands out prominently in the academic calendar of the Kenya School of Government, for on this occasion, we take a break from the very demanding and even depressing routine of lectures, seminar presentations, group work, assignments and, what is more – examinations. Today, we graduands receive the assurance that this rigor has come to an end – at least for some time. Today, we assemble in this Great Hall to celebrate successful completion of a long process of learning. Needless to say, many find learning that is realized spontaneously in the course of professional career or social life generally to be a lot easier than the structured, compressed, and compulsory Diploma in Social Work and Diploma in Public Administration programs that have, moreover, taken you away from family, friends and the community for such a long period of time. Congratulations therefore for successful completion of the programs of study and for the award of Diploma in your respective professional fields. Well done in the search for new knowledge and in sharing with others that which you already knew. Congratulations for the readiness you displayed to unlearn that which you erroneously believed to be the ultimate knowledge and your readiness to supplant it with new, more current ideas and perspectives on different aspects of your professional field. I have been impressed by your quick appreciation that knowledge is truly transitory and that a learner is well advised to keep abreast with ever-shifting knowledge trends. Such shifts have become even more routine in the face of the ever-increasing complexities in human society, particularly in the Governance realm. Public servants are responsible for management of societal affairs, and they will invariably find it compelling to run ahead of the population whom they serve in respect of appreciation of societal phenomena and invocation of appropriate initiatives or responses as the case may be. Couldn’t one say therefore with much certainty that a public servant who remains fixated in old knowledge and old workways thereby locks up oneself in a voluntary servitude of ignorance and irrelevance, inflicting much harm to one’s own professional reputation and to citizens in their prospects for high-level delivery of public service. But there is also the matter of where to excavate the new knowledge from, for we have to be weary of false prophets: one faces the formidable risk of exposure to knowledge of tenuous credibility. Thankfully, in this regard, the Kenya School of Government has been and will remain on hand to fulfil its obligation to transform the Kenyan public service into the most efficient and capable engine for service delivery and implementation of Government agenda for social and economic transformation and progress. We have therefore realigned all our programs to match Government priorities defined in the Big 4 Agenda, the Kenya V2030, SDGs and Africa Agenda 2063. Further, we have taken all necessary measures to underwrite the quality standards of our skills and competency development programs. We are now on the same. In conclusion, I confirm that the graduands before you have successfully completed the prescribed program and have the necessary knowledge, skills, and competencies to discharge their duties to the satisfaction of the expectations of their Ministries and the citizens.]]></description>

				<p><strong>Remarks by the Director General, Prof. Ludeki Chweya, Ph.D., CBS, During the Second Graduation Ceremony for the Award of Diplomas at Lower Kabete on March 6, 2019</strong></p><p>The Chief Guest,<br />Prof. Margaret Kobia, Cabinet Secretary for Public Service, Youth &amp; Gender<br />Dr. Fred Matiang’i, Cabinet Secretary, Ministry of Interior and Coordination<br />of National Government<br />Prof. Francis Kibera, Chairman, Kenya School of Government Council Members of the Council of the Kenya School of Government<br />Kenya School of Government Directors Government officers present Distinguished Graduands<br />Management and Staff of the Kenya School of Government<br />Distinguished Guests,</p><p>Ladies and Gentlemen<br />This day stands out prominently in the academic calendar of the<br />Kenya School of Government, for on this occasion, we take a break<br />from the very demanding and even depressing routine of lectures,<br />seminar presentations, group work, assignments and, what is more – examinations.</p><p>Today, we graduands receive the assurance that this rigor has come<br />to an end – at least for some time. Today, we assemble in this Great Hall to celebrate successful completion of a long process of learning.<br />Needless to say, many find learning that is realized spontaneously in the course of professional career or social life generally to be a lot<br />easier than the structured, compressed, and compulsory Diploma in Social Work and Diploma in Public Administration programs that have, moreover, taken you away from family, friends and the community for such a long period of time.</p><p>Congratulations therefore for successful completion of the programs of study and for the award of Diploma in your respective professional fields. Well done in the search for new knowledge and in sharing with others that which you already knew. Congratulations for the readiness you displayed to unlearn that which you erroneously believed to be the ultimate knowledge and your<br />readiness to supplant it with new, more current ideas and<br />perspectives on different aspects of your professional field.</p><p>I have been impressed by your quick appreciation that knowledge is truly transitory and that a learner is well advised to keep abreast with ever-shifting knowledge trends.
