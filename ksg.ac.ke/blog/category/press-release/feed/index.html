					<description><![CDATA[WHOLE-OF-GOVERNMENT APPROACH GIVEN BOOST THROUGH LAUNCH OF TRAINING CURRICULUM Interior Ministry Chief Administrative Secretary (CAS) Hon. Amb. Hussein Dado has unveiled a training curriculum for Government officers stationed at Kenya’s points of entry and exit. Dubbed the Kenya Coordinated Border Management Programme (KCBMP), the curriculum was launched at the Kenya School of Government in Lower Kabete, Nairobi. The Curriculum will help enhance the whole-of-Government approach between Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) working in Kenya’s points of entry and exit which include land, air and maritime borders. Representing Interior Ministry Cabinet Secretary (CS) Dr. Fred Matiang’i at the event, Amb. Hussein Dado said: “As with all National Government business these days, I am delighted that, like border management, the programme also embraces a whole-of-Government approach and harnesses the capabilities and synergies inherent in all border departments.” The Curriculum was the brainchild of the KSG’s Security Management Institute (SMI) and the Border Management Secretariat (BMS). The latter acted on orders from the Border Control and Operations Coordination Committee (BCOCC), an organ chaired by Interior Principal Secretary (PS) Dr. Eng. Karanja Kibicho. According to Amb. Hon. Hussein Dado, it will now be mandatory for all Government officers working at Kenya’s border points to undergo training in order to continue inculcating the Whole-of-Government Approach in their day-to-day activities. “The Kenya Coordinated Border Management Programme will be escalated to the Cabinet level so that, through a policy, we shall make it mandatory for border agencies to ensure that their officers undergo the training. The training will ultimately make up part of their career progression,” Amb. Dado said. “The Curriculum will help border officials stay up to speed with latest global best practices in border management,” he added. The CAS further hailed the Curriculum saying that it will help Kenya become a regional and international exemplar in promotion of legitimate trade, travel and border security. “The Curriculum will help tackle challenges like smuggling of goods, persons, narcotics and ivory through Kenya’s points of entry and exit which include airports, land and sea borders.” Representing Interior Ministry Principal Secretary (PS), Dr. Eng. Karanja Kibicho, Secretary Internal Security Mr. Wilson Njega commended the collaboration between the KSG’s Security Management Institute and the BMS for developing the training Curriculum. He said it will be of immense benefit to all border officials. “It’s my expectation that this training manual will assist in equipping our border officials with the knowledge, competencies and skills to help them better execute their mandates.” Mr. Njega said that once all border officials undergo the training, he expects a seamless and coordinated approach towards border management and exceptional service delivery at all points of entry and exit. “The endgame is to ensure that delivery of services to people are synchronized, effective, efficient, versatile and advanced enough to respond to emerging issues and challenges.” The KSG Director General (DG) Prof. Ludeki Chweya appreciated the contribution that practitioners make in strengthening KSG’s training programmes by participating in curriculum development and the actual delivery of the programme. Further, Prof. Chweya urged for more research in the area of border security which he said would inform strategic capacity development. “Training effectiveness is also a function of research. It is important that we also conduct research in matters border management such as cross border security, flows and how it can be a challenge to national interest, cross national cooperation and technology. The research findings will enrich training,” said Prof. Chweya. Prof. Chweya lauded the importance that Interior Ministry has placed on building capacity of border officials which realized development of the coordinated border programme. “I thank the Ministry of Interior for recognizing the importance of building competencies to manage our borders better which led to the development of this curriculum. The programme is a product of the mobilization of expertise from the Kenya School of Government and Border Management Security.” BCOCC and BMS Secretary Mr. Kennedy Nyaiyo greeted the concerted efforts through the multi-agency approach, which he said, has seen the enhancement of legitimate trade and travel and heightened security in our borders. He added that the Curriculum will enhance the securitization process of our borders even more. Mr. Nyaiyo thanked National Government agencies and other organizations including the United States Customs and Border Protection (US CBP), International Organization on Migration (IOM), United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) for their continued support. Government organizations with officials stationed at Kenya’s borders/points of entry and exit and members of the BCOCC include: The National Police Service (NPS), Kenya Bureau of Standards (KEBS), the Immigration Department, the National Intelligence Service (NIS), the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA), Kenya Plant Health Inspectorate Service (KEPHIS), the Ministry of Health, Kenya Airports Authority (KAA), Kenya Ports Authority, Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) Kenya Coast Guard Service (KCGS), National Counter Terrorism Center (NCTC), among others. The aforementioned organizations also make up the membership of the BCOCC which was formed through the Security Laws (Amendment) Act, 2014, Section 75. The Committee was established, to among others, co-ordinate the exchange of information between the respective agencies responsible for the security and management of the borders at the designated entry and exit points.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Kenya School of Government collaborates with UN to strengthen infrastructure asset management in Kenya The Kenya School of Government (KSG) is partnering with United Nations agencies, including UN DESA, UNCDF, and UNOPS, to launch an innovative training program aimed at improving the management and maintenance of public infrastructure in Kenya. This initiative addresses critical challenges posed by climate change, shrinking fiscal budgets, and urbanization, which strain the country’s public services. The goal is to bolster the resilience, sustainability, and accessibility of infrastructure assets that provide essential services, such as water and sanitation, waste management, and transportation. In response to these pressing issues, a team of UN experts, led by Prof. Linda Newton, a global UN Advisor on Infrastructure Asset Management (IAM) conducted an intensive Training of Trainers workshop from June 23-27, 2024, for KSG faculty. This workshop aimed to enhance the faculty&#8217;s capacity to deliver IAM programs to National and County Governments. During the workshop&#8217;s opening, Dr. Daniel Platz from UNDESA highlighted research by UNOPSand the University of Oxford, which indicates that infrastructure significantly impacts all 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), affecting up to 92% of their targets. He noted the severe economic consequences of under-maintained infrastructure, with potential annual losses amounting to 2% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Mr. Humphrey Mokaya, Director of the Security Management Institute at KSG, underscored theimportance of equipping public servants with the necessary competencies and tools to manage infrastructure investments effectively for sustainable impact. KSG plans to leverage the extensive UN training toolkits on IAM and adapt them to the Kenyan context. Dr. Mkhululi Ncube of UNCDF emphasized the financial benefits of well-maintainedinfrastructure, stating, &#8220;Well-maintained infrastructure ensures reliable, equitable, and inclusive delivery of essential public services and significantly enhances fiscal space and promotes domestic resource mobilization. Between 70-85% of infrastructure costs typically occur after the construction phase. That is why IAM has become a central focus of UNCDF’s work on local government finance.&#8221; Mr. Luis Pineda of UN DESA reiterated the UN&#8217;s commitment to ongoing collaboration with KSG in designing and integrating new asset management modules into existing programs and developing new training modules for county governments. This partnership represents a significant step towards sustainable infrastructure management in Kenya, ensuring that public services remain resilient, accessible, and sustainable for all.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[MILESTONES ACHIEVED BY KSG IN THE TRANSFROMATION OF THE PUBLIC SERVICE The Kenya School of Government (KSG) is a national institution that responds continuously to capacity development needs across the Public Service by providing training to enhance knowledge,skills and competencies; consultancy services to support organizational reengineering; research to strengthen evidence-based public policymaking and implementation; and public outreach programs to promote uptake of Government programs. The School runs programs that are also continuously reviewed are specially designed to address real capacity gaps with manifest bearing on delivery of services by Ministries, Departments, Agencies and Counties (MDACs). KSG programs are therefore problem-solving interventions that have kept the Public Service on the path of transformation and rising capacity of each MDACs to cope with present and emerging organizational and performancechallenges and improve the quality of services that are offered to citizens. CountiesThe School has in the past ten years focused on supporting County Governments to steersuccessfully through some four critical challenges. The Constitution of Kenya 2010 introduced the devolved system of Government that had to be established on the ground and put into operation from the year 2013. KSG has been able to work with county Governments in establishing county structures, governmental and administrative systems, and development of human resource capacityto manage different functions and bear the enormous responsibilities bestowed by the constitution. The most outstanding of the support has been in the field of financial management with focus onIntegrated Financial Management Information System, Budgeting and Expenditure Management,and Financial Accounting, Reporting and Auditing. A challenge that counties faced was fulfilling the demanding mandate in Local EconomicDevelopment that called for competencies in project planning, implementation, monitoring andevaluation. The School has been able to develop and deliver training and consultancy assignments in these fields of competency requirements that has seen counties introduce and implement programs that continue to improve the living standards of their residents. Counties faced a formidable challenge in management of human resource that the School was on hand to assist in, namely inheritance of three categories of staff: staff that belonged to the defunct Local Authorities, national government staff whose functions had been devolved, and staff that were being recruited by counties. The three categories of staff reflected varied competency levels and work ethos, requiring therefore immediate efforts to create harmony through development of standard human resource policy documents and guidelines, and staff training needs assessment, and roll out of training. One of the transformational features of the Constitution of Kenya 2010 that counties had to abide by was the requirement for public participation in critical decision making matters, especially policy formulation, budget preparation, and development of County Integrated Development Plans(CIDPs). Partnership with the School to develop and implement strategies for public participationalong with offer of relevant training has produced positive results. Management of urban areas, including establishment of local-level governance structures, especially Municipal Boards and Management has been a challenge that the School has played a role in trying to overcome. The Governance and Management of Urban Areas and Cities program, for example,has been of much assistance in development and provision of services delivery system such as in waste management, physical planning, street lighting, and urban transport management, provision of fire services, and recreational facilities. Environmental and climate change mitigation is a new field of urgent concerns that counties had to grapple with in order to get onto the path of sustainable development. In this regard, the School continues to support counties in implementing international and national agenda such the Sustainable Development Goals and Climate Change mitigation, environmental impact assessment environmental and social safeguards; and trained county Climate Change Focal Persons with support from FAO. MinistriesThe civil service has in recent past attempted to come to grips with the compelling need forinnovation and adaptation. Accordingly, the School has developed and rolled out programs that encourage the search for new workways that enhance capacity to cope with new and emerging constrains in society and realize better results. Training in Change Management, Business Process Re-engineering, and productivity improvement have made a notable difference. Furthermore, inadequate preparations for succession management has in many cases constrained output andoverall organizational performance. Therefore, KSG has rolled out programs in skills and competency gaps analysis, Training Needs Assessments, and preparation of staff development plans in effort to address this challenge. Most sections of the civil service face frequent disruption of services due industrial disputes. In order to address this challenge, the School, in partnership with the Salaries and RemunerationCommission (SRC), has developed and rolled out a training program in Public Sector Collective Bargaining, resulting in improved work environment and stable industrial relations. The Kenya Constitution 2010 introduced within the Public Service some novel practices such as public access toinformation, mainstreaming Human Rights agenda in service delivery, and fair administrative action. In order to assist Ministries to adjust to the new requirements, the School runs some new and relevant training programs such in social protection, fair administrative action, and data protection. State CorporationsPublic sector Boards are entrusted with governance responsibility in State Corporations and othersemi-autonomous government agencies, particularly in respect of sound investment decisionsresulting in high returns and rather than losses. To this extent, the School has developed programs in public investment appraisal and risk analysis, Accounting Officers training, and Human Resource Management to align with expectations for returns rather than routine public administration, and performance evaluation and improvement. Sustainability of organizations in tumultuous environments such as the Covid-19 pandemic, globalfinancial economic crises, inflation and how to respond to these environments has placed many in tough situations. Leading Organizations in time of Crisis is one of the programs that the School has rolled out to facilitate overcoming the crunches presented to the Public Service. Mismatch of competencies with job placement has affected job satisfaction and consequentlyperformance of staff and the organization. In this regard the School conducts consultancies inrecruitment of executive staff on the strict criteria of merit; linking competencies to appointment byensuring the right people are appointed to positions through advertising, shortlisting, and selection of the most suitable candidate for [&#8230;]]]></description>

Partnership with the School to develop and implement strategies for public participation<br />along with offer of relevant training has produced positive results.</p><p>Management of urban areas, including establishment of local-level governance structures, especially Municipal Boards and Management has been a challenge that the School has played a role in trying to overcome. The Governance and Management of Urban Areas and Cities program, for example,<br />has been of much assistance in development and provision of services delivery system such as in waste management, physical planning, street lighting, and urban transport management, provision of fire services, and recreational facilities.</p><p>Environmental and climate change mitigation is a new field of urgent concerns that counties had to grapple with in order to get onto the path of sustainable development. In this regard, the School continues to support counties in implementing international and national agenda such the Sustainable Development Goals and Climate Change mitigation, environmental impact assessment <span style="color: var( --e-global-color-text ); font-family: var( --e-global-typography-text-font-family ), Sans-serif; font-weight: var( --e-global-typography-text-font-weight ); letter-spacing: 0em;">environmental and social safeguards; and trained county Climate Change Focal Persons with support </span><span style="color: var( --e-global-color-text ); font-family: var( --e-global-typography-text-font-family ), Sans-serif; font-weight: var( --e-global-typography-text-font-weight ); letter-spacing: 0em;">from FAO.</span></p><p><b>Ministries</b><br />The civil service has in recent past attempted to come to grips with the compelling need for<br />innovation and adaptation. Accordingly, the School has developed and rolled out programs that encourage the search for new workways that enhance capacity to cope with new and emerging constrains in society and realize better results. Training in Change Management, Business Process Re-engineering, and productivity improvement have made a notable difference. Furthermore, inadequate preparations for succession management has in many cases constrained output and<br />overall organizational performance. Therefore, KSG has rolled out programs in skills and competency gaps analysis, Training Needs Assessments, and preparation of staff development plans in effort to address this challenge.</p><p>Most sections of the civil service face frequent disruption of services due industrial disputes. In order to address this challenge, the School, in partnership with the Salaries and Remuneration<br />Commission (SRC), has developed and rolled out a training program in Public Sector Collective Bargaining, resulting in improved work environment and stable industrial relations. The Kenya Constitution 2010 introduced within the Public Service some novel practices such as public access to<br />information, mainstreaming Human Rights agenda in service delivery, and fair administrative action. In order to assist Ministries to adjust to the new requirements, the School runs some new and relevant training programs such in social protection, fair administrative action, and data protection.</p><p><b>State Corporations</b><br />Public sector Boards are entrusted with governance responsibility in State Corporations and other<br />semi-autonomous government agencies, particularly in respect of sound investment decisions<br />resulting in high returns and rather than losses. To this extent, the School has developed programs in public investment appraisal and risk analysis, Accounting Officers training, and Human Resource <span style="color: var( --e-global-color-text ); font-family: var( --e-global-typography-text-font-family ), Sans-serif; font-weight: var( --e-global-typography-text-font-weight ); letter-spacing: 0em;">Management to align with expectations for returns rather than routine public administration, and </span><span style="color: var( --e-global-color-text ); font-family: var( --e-global-typography-text-font-family ), Sans-serif; font-weight: var( --e-global-typography-text-font-weight ); letter-spacing: 0em;">performance evaluation and improvement.</span></p><p>Sustainability of organizations in tumultuous environments such as the Covid-19 pandemic, global<br />financial economic crises, inflation and how to respond to these environments has placed many in tough situations. Leading Organizations in time of Crisis is one of the programs that the School has rolled out to facilitate overcoming the crunches presented to the Public Service.</p><p>Mismatch of competencies with job placement has affected job satisfaction and consequently<br />performance of staff and the organization. In this regard the School conducts consultancies in<br />recruitment of executive staff on the strict criteria of merit; linking competencies to appointment by<br />ensuring the right people are appointed to positions through advertising, shortlisting, and selection of the most suitable candidate for the different positions in senior management. The aim is to enhance productivity and performance in State Corporations.</p><p>Further, the School runs induction programs to acquaint newly appointed staff, whether in Boards or management into the peculiar public sector doctrines, ethics, ethos and practices that in many ways tend to be different from what obtains in the private and NGO sectors.</p><p>Boards are trained on policy making and investment strategies for higher returns; public institutions but with private sector orientation; investment appraisal, good corporate governance, management<br />of Public Sector to overcome conflict within Boards, failure to appreciate the mandate of Boards, conflict with management, general stewardship of Boards, prudent utilization of resources, and<br />capacity building for prudent decision making for higher returns. Programs at the School that seek to address these challenges are: Accounting Officers Programs for CEOs, Corporate Governance<br />for Public Sector Boards, Induction programs, Finance for Non-finance Managers among others. <span style="color: var( --e-global-color-text ); font-family: var( --e-global-typography-text-font-family ), Sans-serif; font-weight: var( --e-global-typography-text-font-weight ); letter-spacing: 0em;">Cross Cutting Competencies in the Public Sector</span></p><p>The quality of public services and achievement of targets is not measured by the number of hours<br />put into the work by public officials but by the targets achieved within the hours put in. The School promotes this through results-based management programs such as Productivity Measurement and<br />Improvement as well as Performance Evaluation to ensure value driven public officers for best results in the public service.</p><p>Reports about loss of public funds and unaccountable use of public resources have brought to fore the need for the School to develop programs that promote public service doctrines, ethics, and values under the KSG Institute of Public Service Ethics and Values. Other programs in this genre aim to promote professionalism, particularly adherence to standard operational procedures as set out in different professional fields.</p><p>The e-Learning Development Institute has invested in the Learning Management System (LMS) and video conferencing that has been instrumental in the digitization of functions and operations in order to reach a wider clientele and enhance efficiency of the business process and service delivery programs. This was also strengthened through the response of the School to the Covid-19 pandemic by automation of most of its programs.</p>					</div>
