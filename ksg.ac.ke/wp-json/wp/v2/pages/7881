Trainees graduating from KSG are sufficiently prepared to serve consistent with established professional standards. The School has reviewed some of the old programs and introduced new syllabi intended to address existing shortfalls in competency of public servants and in service delivery.&nbsp;Training programs may also be custom-made upon request to meet specialized requirements of individual public institutions. Admission into the programs is subject to fulfilment of course prerequisites. The COVID-19 pandemic in Kenya and around the world has challenged the School into placing more and more programs on the e-learning platform, including programs that focus on the competency of health workers engaged in the fight against the pandemic and frontline officers in other professions. Consultation with the Ministry of Health has resulted in establishment of measures that enhance health and safety of course participants. Training dates for all programs may be as far as possible scheduled to suit client convenience.
