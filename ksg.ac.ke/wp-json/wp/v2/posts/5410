The words deliberate and intention are important in this statement as they draw the line between actively practicing something and passively learning it. It is a choice that one makes when they have had the advantage to be taught or learn a new skill.<\/p>\n<p>This is the challenge the Director Security Management Institute, Mr. Humphrey Mokaya put to County Engagement Forum (CEF) members in his address during the closing ceremony of the Prevention and Control of Violent Extremism program on Friday 27th August, 2021 at KSG Lower Kabete. \u201cAfter your training, let us see change in all you do; change from how we have been doing things to adopting a new way.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Mr. Mokaya highlighted on the need for drastic action in the area of Violent Extremism which has been a security agenda in our country and region for years now. He reminded the graduands of the delicate nature of the issue of Violent Extremism that requires a lot of tact in countering the vice. \u201cLet us not forget the fragility of this issue and the diplomacy that is required in handling it. Of importance, is enlightening those that you work with.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He reminded them on the significance of maintaining networks with colleagues which will enable them exchange information and in the process, develop better ways of dealing with security in their region. \u201cIt is one of the best ways to increase your information base,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>His words were echoed by Mr. Cheboi, a representative of the National Counter Terrorism Center (NCTC) as he delivered a speech on behalf of the Institution\u2018s Acting Director, Dr. Roslyn Macharia. \u201cWhat we seeing unfold in Afghanistan is a risk we face in our country should we chose to remain silent on the issue of Violent extremism,\u201d the speech read in part. \u201cIt should be a call to all of us, to do more than the usual after this training so that we will not have to deal with a caliphate which is the bigger picture of the current situation in our country and region\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Prevention and control of Violent Extremism is a program that was developed by the School\u2018s Security Management Institute in collaboration with the National Counter Terrorism Center and Mercy Corps. It attracts personnel in the security sector at the county level as well as the national level to undergo training in order for them to understand the vice and develop strategies to curb it more efficiently. In the past one decade, Kenya has experienced several terror attacks and terror related threats that are associated with outlawed militia groups. In order to carry out such activities, these groups recruit the youth and train them to carry attacks in different parts of the country. It therefore creates the need to be a step ahead to identify networks and patterns of such recruitments and activities happening in a region.<\/p>\n<p>The Kenya School of Government has been on the forefront to ensure that it brings on board the best facilitators for this program. Class president Ms. Kezia Neema acknowledged the expertise demonstrated in every class. \u201cThere were different facilitators for every class, and each one of them made you desire to learn more. It was in the delivery of the information and professional way that every topic was handled that makes KSG the best institution,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":3442,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[128],"tags":[132],"views":879,"post_mailing_queue_ids":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/ksg.ac.ke\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5410"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/ksg.ac.ke\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/ksg.ac.ke\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/ksg.ac.ke\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/ksg.ac.ke\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=5410"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/ksg.ac.ke\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5410\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":5411,"href":"https:\/\/ksg.ac.ke\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/5410\/revisions\/5411"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/ksg.ac.ke\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/3442"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/ksg.ac.ke\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=5410"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/ksg.ac.ke\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=5410"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/ksg.ac.ke\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=5410"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
